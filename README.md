# Dockerized Druid

This is the source repository for my Druid docker images. In addition to the Dockerfiles, there is also a docker-compose.yml that can be used to bring up the whole cluster.

The Druid images assume Zookeeper is running with the alias `zookeeper` and Derby is running with the alias `derby`.
